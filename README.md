# Async demo

## FIRST

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new file in the demos repo with your name or nickname (demos/[name].js)

## Coding Steps inside the file you just created

step 1: Install a library for API calls, request or axios
step 2: Make a call to the Github API (e.g. https://api.github.com/users/gwenf/repos, full API is at https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/available-endpoints/)
step 3: Try chaining .then() and .catch() onto the Promises
step 4: Now create an async function and make the call using await syntax
step 5: Try out different endpoints and print out your results

## AFTER

1. Write your code & add/commit/push your changes to your forked repo
2. Make a PR back to the original
